I am deeply interested in finding solutions for clean energy and tackle sustainability challenges. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at Discovergy (Germany). Here I am working on the problem of generating a breakdown of electricity consumption for households so that consumers have a better understanding of which of their appliances and systems are consuming how many kilo-watt hours and at what times.
