I am interested in finding smarter ways to generate and consume energy and help in the transition to a more sustainable world. Currently, I work as a Data Scientist at [Discovergy](www.discovergy.com) (Germany). Here I am working on the problem of generating a breakdown of electricity consumption for households so that consumers have a better understanding of which of their appliances and systems are consuming how many kilo-watt hours and at what times. 

I am also trying to develop a better understanding of some of the social challenges we face as a society. Impactpreneurs is an initiative that I am helping out with. We are trying to create the world's largest source of information on social enterprises and organisations. This will help people in the ecosystem discover each other's work and develop investment and collaboration opportunities. 

Other than this, I am working to develop a regular meditation practice. 

In my free time, I am either going through a book ([here is my reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43336102-shubham-bansal)) or talking a long walk or catching up with my friends or following cricket.
